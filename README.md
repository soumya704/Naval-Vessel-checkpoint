# Naval-Vessel-checkpoint

This project develops a robust Machine Learning solution for predictive maintenance in naval vessels, specifically focusing on forecasting the Gas Turbine Compressor decay state coefficient. Leveraging aa comprehensive dataset of over 11,900 operational records with 19 critical features, the project meticulously performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python's Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries to extract key insights and ensure data quality. It implements and rigorously evaluates four diverse regression modelsâ€”Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression, and a sophisticated Neural Network featuring 5 hidden layers. Through a thorough assessment using four standard metrics (MSE, R2 Score, MAE, MAPE), the project achieved exceptional performance, with top models demonstrating R2 Scores consistently above 0.9999. This high-precision predictive capability is designed to enable proactive maintenance strategies, significantly improving operational efficiency and potentially reducing vessel downtime by up to 25%.
